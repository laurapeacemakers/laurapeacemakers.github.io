## The topic

There is a lot of talking going on about migrants in European media and politics. But instead of raising awareness for the problems migrants are facing in their home countries, stereotypes and generalizations prevail. We started this project to focus on the individuals behind the process, their stories, views, motivations, beliefs. Our aim is to foster **multicategorization** and **contact** with migrants in Europe.

## How do we do that?

In our town Cesena (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) we organize intercultural dinners and events in public spaces. Migrants and locals are bringing food and eat together. During those events we collect the recipes and let people tell their stories. We upload the recipe connected to the story of the chef plus everything else he/she wants to share on this website. 

## Who are we?

Adele, Leonardo, Laura, Pier and Chiara, five Psychology students from University of Bologna (Campus of Cesena), Italy.
This project is part of the bigger Erasmus+ project "Peacemakers", led by Koc University and other partner Universities. Its aim is to foster a more peaceful generation in Europe and in Turkey that approaches migrants with positive attitudes.
